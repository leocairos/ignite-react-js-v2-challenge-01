## ðŸš€ About

Ignite is an acceleration program for developers developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

## ðŸ’» About this challenge

In this challenge, you developed a task control application in the **to-do list** style, which contains the following functionalities:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as completed
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress

Despite being few features, it was necessary to remember concepts such as:

- States
- Immutability of state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization

To complete this challenge, it was also necessary to learn about array manipulation methods such as `map`, `filter` or even `reduce`.

## Application layout

For this application, a layout was provided to be followed and implemented all the functionalities designed in figma.
